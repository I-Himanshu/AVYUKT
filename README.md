>In terms of our previous interactions with participants across multiple colleges in the locality and around, this ***Environment Day*** ``5th June 2021``, We sparked upon an idea to utilize this influx of participants and the lock-down to our advantage to generate a college hosted ``Techno-Cultural-Fest`` a general kick-start base of which are discussed below.

○  To be taken on the “bookwidgets” platform.

•	Platform - google forms
•	Rules-
	1.	Allowed to browse
	2.	No option type(answer in 1-2 word type)
**ROBOTICS** (not yet discussed briefly)
To ensure maximum participation and uplift their enthusiasm, Perks and goodies have to be great in this event.
•	Rules (more to explore and discuss)-
	3.	Participants have to build a robot and present it live in front of the judging panel.
	4.	They also have to send a detailed video on function, coding, and working of the robot a day before going in front of the judging panel (just like resume before the interview)
•	Theme (working and function)
Like going in every direction or should follow a path (like on black and white path), or picking something, (give some ideas for theme).
We would like to hear those mentioned events related to our branch like **drone bot** and **chip-based programming** and love to help in making it happen.
Personally, I a am big fan of cultural table especially submission type. I love to help in framing those events. some of my interests are **virtual CID, Mr. & Ms. Avyukt,** and many more.
*My suggestions*:-
**Selfie movie event**- I think we all know famous YouTuber BB and his vines. So in this event participants have to make a movie using selfie cameras following the theme and rules provided. Participants can be solo or in a group so that they can make movies with their friends who are far from them. And in this way, we bring people closer. Open for improvisation.
**Photography**:- (we can keep this event for the fest or push this in  pre-fest event)
Photography is always an event of maximum participation. (we also witness this in event of Environment day)
Rules-
60% weightage on the photograph.
40% weightage on the statement.
To submit-
	1. A photograph
	2. Title, type or style or genre, Location, minimum 2-3 sentences description about photograph
We should also organize some pre-fest events and workshops. It will help in marketing a lot.

>There should be one more competition like **drone flying competition** in which the participants will have to fly his drone and compete with others participants. There will three level in which the 1st level they have to make round of academic block (or we will specify the place) and  in 2nd round there will be some obstacles like zig zag and circle type path they have to travel . In this competition the participants will have to compete with in limited time  and safely crosses all the obstacles will be considered as winner.
